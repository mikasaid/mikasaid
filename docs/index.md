### MHi! I’m MikasaID (IPS: /ˈhæɹi/) or usually known as MIKASAID. Is a fan/enthusiast of system especially the Linux ecosystem (and the internals) as well as Unix-like (POSIX). Since childhood, I was interested in how a system works. Starting from electronics, radio frequency, and computer networks, as well as the concept of the computer itself. However, I did all of that as a hobby by self-taught research (which is actually also influenced by the environment). Having a little side of Aesthete, Melophile, and Philosophile in my daily life makes me fall deeper and deeper into the abyss of Arts and Sciences especially Linguistics and Psychology. Thirst for knowledge that is only a drop of the ocean, except the Knowledge of Allah SWT which has no limits.

If you have any questions, you can contact me at the contact listed. Never stop learning!
