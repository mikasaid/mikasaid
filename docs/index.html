## Welcome to Mr Ghost Family

You can use the [editor on GitHub]

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://https://mrghost.bio.link/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

<h2></h2><br>
<p align="center">   
   [<a href="mikasaid@proton.me">e-mail</a>]
  </samp>
</p>

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mikasaid/mikasaid/settings/ID). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
